# Ctrl-Drive

Ctrl-Drive is an open-source project aimed at building a robust, competition-ready RC car from scratch. Our project focuses on several key goals:

## Project Goals

1. **Parts Adaptability:** Our design emphasizes the use of readily available components, ensuring ease of access for builders.
2. **Learn Through Building:** Dive deep into the realms of RC design, electronics, and fabrication by tackling challenges and solving problems.
3. **Robotics Competition Ready:** Ctrl-Drive's features are tailored for high performance in robotics events, providing a competitive edge.
4. **Collaborative Community:** Join our supportive community, where you can both contribute and learn alongside like-minded enthusiasts.

## Prerequisites

- Enthusiasm for robotics and problem-solving.
- Basic electronics and mechanical aptitude.
- Willingness to research and experiment.

## Tech Stack

- **Design:** Utilize Solidworks for mechanical design and KiCad for circuit board design.
- **Microcontroller:** Employ the ESP-32 microcontroller for control.
- **Fabrication:** Utilize 3D Printing (Creality Slicer) for fabricating parts.
